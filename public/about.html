<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Diana Zainullina. I live in the USA.</p>

<p>Web development has always been my desire. I like working on the different kind of projects. I believe that achieving greatness in a particular field, drives from the love and passion you have for it.
</p>

<p>I also studied 'Geology of Oil and Gas' and 'Accounting'. I am artistic. I've graduated from dancing and painting schools. </p>

<p>As soon as I will be finished with my lessons and have a portfolio that will meet your expectations, it would be an honor for me to work with you.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
